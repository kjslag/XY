# XY

Simulate the [XY model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_XY_model) using webgl!
Hold down the mouse button to apply a force that attracts vortices and repels anti-vortices.
The vortices and anti-vortices are emergent particle excitations with long-range interactions, similar to electrons and positrons.

Try it!
